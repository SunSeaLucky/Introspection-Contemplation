## If you have something to do or to learn, you have not to arrange it as a daily task. Find out sub-task of it and arrange them when you are idle.

## There is no need to be hurry to do anything. After decades of trying, I've known that carefully(No needs to be too careful) do something at a normal speed is the most efficient way to complete task.

## THere is no need to angry or anxious with something. As game player's target is to enjoy but not imprison himself.
