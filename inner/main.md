1. If you have something to do or to learn, you have not to arrange it as a daily task. Find out sub-task of it and arrange them when you are idle.

2. There is no need to be hurry to do anything. After decades of trying, I've known that carefully(No needs to be too careful) do something at a normal speed is the most efficient way to complete task.

3. There is no need to angry or anxious with something. As game player's target is to enjoy but not imprison himself.
