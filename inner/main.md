1. If you have something to do or to learn, you have not to arrange it as a daily task. Find out sub-task of it and arrange them when you are idle.

2. There is no need to be hurry to do anything. After decades of trying, I've known that carefully(No needs to be too careful) do something at a normal speed is the most efficient way to complete task.

3. There is no need to angry or anxious with something. As game player's target is to enjoy but not imprison himself.

4. I always tell myself I will not do this because: **I can do this, but do something else makes me feel good. So I choose latter and I am  still highly self-discipline**. Obvious, itself is not self-discipline which used me about ten years to know that.
